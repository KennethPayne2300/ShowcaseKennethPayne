                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    I like building with legos I even made a lego spear,<br>
                    I like playing outside Its fun so what if I'm 17 playing outside is the best,<br> 
                    and also videogames (This was probably obvious)<br>
                    I have tried multiple different times to make games and have only recently had success with it.<br>
                    I wan't to build a game that uses AI to make whatever you want so it'll basically be an infinite game with endless possibilities, it also could use AI to make storylines, (Its been very helpful for making lore for my OC).<br>
                    I can't always find the right words for what I'm thinking but I have been told I'm very creative<br>
                    If I ever go on a rant about my favorite show don't stop me it won't work<br>
                    I love lego Ninjago, The Owl House, Hazbin Hotel, Marvel, phineas and ferb and the shows connected to it, gravity falls, 
                </p>
                <h3>Strengths</h3>
                <p>
                    I am very active<br>
                    I am a good person to talk to when youre having a hard time (because I won't try and think of a solution just let you have a shoulder to cry on)<br>
                    I am good at following directions when I remember them
                </p>
                <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
                <p>
                    I sometimes forget random things (there is litterally no pattern to it not even "I forget the bad memories" or "I forget the good memories" its just "I forgot")<br>
                    I get distracted easily
                </p>
