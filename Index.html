                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>I like building with legos, I like playing outside, and also videogames. I have tried multiple different times to make games and have only recently had success with it. I wan't to build a game that uses AI to make whatever you want so it'll basically be an infinite game with endless possibilities, it also could use AI to make storylines, (Its been very helpful for making lore for my OC).
