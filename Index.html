                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    I like building with legos I even made a lego spear,<br>
                    I like playing outside Its fun so what if I'm 17 playing outside is the best,<br> 
                    and also videogames (This was probably obvious)<br>
                    I have tried multiple different times to make games and have only recently had success with it.<br>
                    I wan't to build a game that uses AI to make whatever you want so it'll basically be an infinite game with endless possibilities, it also could use AI to make storylines,<br>
                    (Its been very helpful for making lore for my OC).<br>
                    I can't always find the right words for what I'm thinking but I have been told I'm very creative<br>
                    If I ever go on a rant about my favorite show don't stop me it won't work
                    I love lego Ninjago, The Owl House, Hazbin Hotel, Marvel, phineas and ferb and the shows connected to it, gravity falls, 
                </p>
                <h3>Strengths</h3>
                <p>
                    I am very active<br>
                    I am a good person to talk to when youre having a hard time (because I won't try and think of a solution just let you have a shoulder to cry on)<br>
                    I am good at following directions when I remember them
                </p>
                <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
                <p>
                    I sometimes forget random things (there is litterally no patter to it not even "I forget the bad memories" or "I forget the good memories" its just "I forgot")<br>
                    I get distracted easily

                </p>
                <h3>non-coding related things I made</h3>
                <h4>3d art class</h4>

                <h2>The Future</h2>
                <p>I am planning on going to college, I just don't know where yet. I'm also planning on getting a job as a game developer. I am definitely not going to retire.</p>
